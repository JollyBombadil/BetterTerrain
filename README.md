# BetterTerrain for RimWorld

Finished...
-Tropical Forest


Playable just not super pretty...
-Temperate Forest


Not Recommended to play with mod active...
-Every other zone

==================================================
The mod generates terrain much differently causing smoother transitions and different focuses for different parts of the map.  One side of the map can be dry and mountainy, while the other is lush.

The Tropical Forest was made to make it feel like a brazilian rain forest.  That means tons of rivers, tons of dense slow-to-traverse forests, little good farm land and few open areas.
The Temperate Forest was made to draw more on the 'cradle of civilizations' idea.  The good farm land is near water.
