========================Details==========================

The mod generates terrain much differently causing smoother transitions and different focuses for different parts of the map.  One side of the map can be dry and mountainy, while the other is lush.

----Mountains---- fallow the contours of the map more (with some nifty variations I made).  It means that mountains consistently create much more interesting and usefull shapes.

----The Temperate Forest---- was made to draw more on the 'cradle of civilizations' idea.  There are large plains while the good farm land is near water.

----The Tropical Forest---- was made to make it feel like a brazilian rain forest.  That means tons of rivers, tons of dense slow-to-traverse forests, little good farm land and few open areas.


======================PROGRESS==========================

1/xx - remade the mountain generation functions and terrain generation functions.

2/1 - tropical forest is both beautifull and functional.  Added rivers.  Created actual marshes.  Created rare-high-ground areas and rare fertile areas.

2/2 - temperate forest is both beautifull and functionl.  Added plains.  Added lakes.  Much more variation in tree/bush sprites.  Generally farm friendly Biome.

2/3 - tweaked mountain generation for better formations near water.  Made different tiles have different amounts of precious mineable resources.  Temperate<Desert<boreal<shrubland<tundra

2/4 - compatibility work.  Updated birch trees to look fabulous.

2/5 - grass.  so much grass.  And its fluffy!!!
