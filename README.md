# BetterTerrain for RimWorld

Finished...
-Mountain generation
-Tropical Forest
-Temperate Forest

Not Recommended to play with mod active...
-Every other zone

==================================================
The mod generates terrain much differently causing smoother transitions and different focuses for different parts of the map.  One side of the map can be dry and mountainy, while the other is lush.

----Mountains---- fallow the contours of the map more (with some nifty variations I made).  It means that mountains consistently create much more interesting and usefull shapes.

----The Tropical Forest---- was made to make it feel like a brazilian rain forest.  That means tons of rivers, tons of dense slow-to-traverse forests, little good farm land and few open areas.

----The Temperate Forest---- was made to draw more on the 'cradle of civilizations' idea.  There are large plains while the good farm land is near water.


2/1 - tropical forest is both beautifull and functional.  Added rivers.  Created actual marshes.  Created rare-high-ground areas and rare fertile areas.
2/2 - temperate forest is both beautifull and functionl.  Added plains.  Added lakes.  Much more variation in tree/bush sprites.  Generally farm friendly Biome.
